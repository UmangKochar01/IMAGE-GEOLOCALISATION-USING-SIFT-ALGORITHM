# IMAGE-GEOLOCALISATION-USING-SIFT-ALGORITHM

India's  home-made  navigational  system,  named  NAVIC  by  Prime  Minister 
Narendra Modi, has developed a technical problem. One of the seven satellites in the Indian 
version of the American Global Positioning System or GPS is malfunctioning, as a result 
of which it's not visible. Despite the flaw, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System 
is still functional and we are bound to use the same system with the  problems incorporated 
in it. Also it has been observed that the GPS errors of mobile phones are not greater than 
100 meters, such errors are not acceptable in many application. 

Thus we aim to minimize these issues by proposing “Imaged Based Geo-localization” 
which enables us to precisely and effectively find the exact geo co-ordinates of the place 
where the image is captured. This will be helpful for a large range of applications which 
requires the geo-location.


# Applications

➢     Precise location determination for Medical emergency.
➢     Helping Armed forces for predicting accurate geo co-ordinates.
➢     Photo tagging in social media.
➢     Identification of crime scenes will be helpful for Cops.
➢     In Travel & Tourism. 


Conclusion

Dominant  Sets  Framework  is  a  novel  framework  for  city-scale  image  geo- 
localization. Specifically, dominant set clustering-based multiple NN feature matching 
approach is introduced. Both global and local features are used in our matching step in 
order to improve the matching accuracy. In the experiments, carried out on two large city- 
scale datasets, demonstrated the effectiveness of post processing employing the novel 
constrained dominant set over a simple voting scheme. Furthermore, we showed that our 
proposed approach is 200 times, on average, faster than GMCP-based approach . Finally, 
the newly-created dataset (WorldCities) containing more than 300k Google Street View 
images used in this experiments is available to the public for research purposes.
